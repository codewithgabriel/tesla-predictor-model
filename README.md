# Tesla RF Model Predictor

This project is a machine learning application for predicting Tesla-related outcomes using a Random Forest model. It provides a simple interface for users to input data and receive predictions based on a pre-trained model.

## Features
- Loads a pre-trained Random Forest model (`tesla_rf_model.pkl`)
- Accepts user input for prediction
- Provides prediction results via a user-friendly interface

## Files
- `app.py`: Main application script (likely a web or CLI interface)
- `model_script.py`: Contains model loading and prediction logic
- `tesla_rf_model.pkl`: Pre-trained Random Forest model

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Required Python packages (see below)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/codewithgabriel/tesla-predictor-model.git
   cd tesla-predictor-model
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If `requirements.txt` is missing, install packages used in your scripts, e.g. `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `streamlit`)*

### Usage
Run the application:
```powershell
python app.py
```
Or, if using Streamlit:
```powershell
streamlit run app.py
```
